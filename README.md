# Python-projects

## Background

Time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues.In this project, I used the concepts I've learned to complete the required PyBank Python problem. Both activities present a real-world situation in which my newfound Python skills will come in handy. 


## PyBank

In this repo, I create a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. With a randomly choosen financial dataset. This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, the company has rather lax standards for accounting, so the records are simple.)
The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


The total number of months included in the dataset.


The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.


The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.


The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.


The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.



## PyRamen

Analyze how well the business did on a per-product basis (as you have several choices of ramen) in order to better understand which products are doing well, which are doing poorly, and, ultimately, which products may need to be removed or changed.
A  need to innovate. With more customers and more data to process, a tool that will allow you to automate your calculations in a manner that scales with your business.
